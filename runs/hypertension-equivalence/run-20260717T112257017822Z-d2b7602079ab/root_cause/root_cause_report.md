## Causal Findings

### 1. Plausible root cause: Investigate root_cause.engine.probabilistic_semantics as a possible explanation for signal 'signal:1f81c70580a520727657b886' using protocol 'protocol.generic_root_cause:v1.0.0'.

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Finding ID | root-cause-finding:ee5e10bc6147701d421cfa0d |
| Status | plausible |
| Confidence | low |
| Domain | domain.global |
| Difference classification | unknown |
| Signals | signal:1f81c70580a520727657b886 |
| Attribution | Unknown — available evidence does not support a concrete source location. |

**Explanation**

Protocol applicability matched validation domain 'domain.global'. The protocol does not assert causality; it defines deterministic evidence and verification steps for this category.

## Limitations

- The leading hypothesis lacks sufficient supporting evidence.
- No deterministic verification was available.
- No non-refuted candidate remained after deterministic assessment.
- Candidate generation exceeded RootCauseRequest.max_candidates; complete alternative-candidate components were retained in deterministic source-priority order.
- No explicit verification plan was available for candidate.
